# qstat_status

qstat_status is a parser and pretty-printer for the output data generated by Torque Resource Manager qstat
program and pbsnode. It will parse the output produced by qstat / pbsnode and display it in a table.

As all the parsing is done using PHP, it can also be used to generate a web dashboard.
